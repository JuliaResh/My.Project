[8C[0mWow.  Two years.  How many of you have been in a group 
[A[63Cwhen it
celebrated its second anniversary?  A not outstanding number...
[A[63C  now how many
of you have managed to spend two years in the same group?  Twen
[A[63Cty-four months..
[A[79C Only [1mseven hundred and twenty days?[0m  It seems 
[A[46Cat times that I've just started
the group four weeks ago, and at times, with our ever-shifting 
[A[63Cmemberlist, that
[A[79C is basically what I've done.  

        If you want to skip all of this rambling philosophical 
[A[63Cbullshit and get
[A[79C down to the soft porn at the bottom I won't blame you.

        Before I do any more nostalgic reminiscing, I'd like to
[A[63C thank the 
people who have made this trip interesting and endlessly challe
[A[63Cnging:  [1mFab One[0m,
[A[79C [1mDarkforce[0m, and [1mHalaster[0m.  A group stag
[A[38Cnates without a conflict and I'd like to 
[A[79C think that by outlasting the first two we have emerged
[A[54C improved from the
experience, but it is through the last individual that it reall
[A[63Cy got
interesting - competing with a co-conspirator.  Hal, to give yo
[A[63Cu credit, I'd 
have to say that somehow Fire profited more from the merger tha
[A[63Cn Mist did in
the long run.  I haven't the slightest idea in hell how you man
[A[63Caged to pull it 
[A[79C off, but you get the [1;33mbig gold stars[0m next to

[0m        Anyway, in the two years I've been left here to fen
[A[59Cd for myself, I've
gotten to know so many of you - no one can view the scene like 
[A[63Ca group leader 
does - keeping track of former members as the years pass.  If 
[A[62C[1mNit[0m had phoned

[A[55CEven if Mist hasn't 
managed to leave too solid a mark on the scene on its own, it s
[A[63Ceems that
the experience of having been in the group is a benchmark of it
[A[63Cs own.

        Though it's hard not to feel personally slighted when a

[1mMarch?[2C[0m(well, we did release the cookbook last month
[A[53C, but that was silly.)
- anyway, we've still been writing articles for it.  Well, this
[A[63C is where the 
pot boils over.  We've coded up everything which was to be in i

      Okay, I lied.  I have a few more things to say.  Be sure 
[A[63Cto check out the
[A[79C portrait that [1mSilent Knight[0m drew of [1mME, 
[A[40C[0mCthulu.  Er... portrait?  Caricature
more fits the bill, but I actually do look like that.  Just in 
[A[63Ccase you'd ever
wondered.

this is our 18th pack.  However, our 2nd anniversary should hav

[A[44C[2CDone?  All right, it's like this.
[A[79C Mistigris was formed in July 1994, after the death of 
[A[54C[1mImperial[0m.  We took three
months to prepare our debut pack, and the time was well-investe
[A[63Cd.  Since then,
though we have made many side releases of outside projects and 
[A[63Cmusic disks and
the like, we haven't managed to always release a pack every mon
[A[63Cth (particularly
[A[79C in the later stretches of 1995.)  I don't want to say 
[A[54Ctoo much here,  but this
might be the last time that you see a Mist pack for a long time
[A[63C as well, at 
least in this half of 1996.  

[39C[1m?[0m![1m?

[0mOkay.  That's all I had to say.  Having thoroughly confused
[A[59C you, now for the

[A[54Crbera as we had all
[31Cpreviously thought.)

The one that we actually used in the pack was by Platinum 8)

The flying saucer was by, as the sig reads, Sentience of mistig
[A[63Cris.

Providing that strange stuff happens between the writing of the
[A[63C infofile and
the release of the pack, we may also feature daintily some ansi
[A[63C work by Mavrik
of Fire, and regardless, we will be showing his expertise in Ki
[A[63Cthe coding.

Finally, Trinity has returned, in changing his handle to Reveng
[A[63Ce!, and then 
Bandicoot.  So no, he's not ripping anyone 8)

(just decided I'd sneak that in there.)
